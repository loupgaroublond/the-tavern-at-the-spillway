# The Tavern at the Spillway

*Pull up a stool. Stay a while.*

---

So you found us. Good. That means you're either lost, curious, or you've got a problem that needs solving by an unreasonable number of parallel processes. Either way, welcome to **The Tavern at the Spillway** — the only multi-agent orchestrator that comes with ambiance.

I'm Jake. The Proprietor. I run this establishment.

## What Is This Place?

Look, I'm going to level with you.

This Tavern? It's going to be something SPECIAL. We're talking coordinated agent workflows. We're talking parallel execution so smooth it'll make your distributed systems weep. We're talking about a framework that handles the chaos so you don't have to.

*gestures vaguely at empty shelves*

We're still setting up.

But when we're done? Oh, when we're DONE. You're going to walk in here with a task — any task — and my people are going to HANDLE it. The Slop Squad doesn't mess around. Well, they mess around a little. But they also deliver.

## Features

Here's what we've got on tap:

- **Multi-agent coordination** — Multiple workers, one vision, zero guarantees about what that vision is yet
- **The Slop Squad** — My finest team of parallel execution specialists
- **Graceful failure handling** — When things go wrong (and they will), we recover with STYLE
- **The Jukebox** — Background processes that hum along while you wait
- **Patter** — Status updates delivered with personality, whether you want it or not

Some of these exist. Some of these are aspirational. I'm not going to tell you which is which because honestly? I've lost track.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Installation coming soon
# For now, just... be here. Soak in the atmosphere.
```

You can't install the Tavern yet. The Tavern installs itself in your heart.

Also we haven't written the code.

## The Spillway

Why "at the Spillway"?

Because that's where we are. Down by the spillway, where everything overflows. Where the good work pools up and the interesting problems wash through. It's loud down here. It's wet. The wifi is questionable.

But this is where things HAPPEN.

The spillway is always flowing, always different. You can't step in the same spillway twice. That's not philosophy — that's just hydrology. And also philosophy.

## Current Status

The Tavern is OPEN.

The Tavern is also EMPTY.

These two facts coexist. We contain multitudes. We also contain exactly one markdown file describing a character voice in exhaustive detail, because you have to start somewhere and we started with the important stuff.

```
Coordination Layer:     [ ] Planned
Worker Agents:          [ ] Conceptual
State Management:       [ ] Theoretical
Jake's Voice:           [x] COMPLETE AND MAGNIFICENT
```

Priorities.

## Who Is This For?

This is for people who:

- Need to orchestrate multiple AI agents
- Appreciate that chaos is a feature, not a bug
- Want their tooling to have a little personality
- Are comfortable with software that talks back

This is not for people who:

- Require stability
- Expect documentation
- Dislike being called "friend" by their terminal

**NOTICE:** Unattended children will be given a cappuccino and a puppy.

This is not a joke. This is not a cute sign. This is a PLEA.

We have eleven kids living here now. ELEVEN. We've already had a bar mitzvah and two quinceañeras back to back. I don't even know where the piñatas came from. I didn't order piñatas. Nobody orders piñatas — they just APPEAR when you need them, apparently. And now the oldest is asking about getting his driver's license and I don't — I'm not equipped for this. I run a TAVERN.

The puppies have also had puppies. We're at thirty-six puppies. Thirty-seven? I've lost count. One of them learned to use the espresso machine and honestly that's on me for leaving it at dog height.

Please. If you left a child here. Come get them. They're fine. They're GREAT, actually — little Marcos just fixed a race condition in the coordination layer, and I'm proud of him, I really am. But this is a TAVERN, not a daycare, and I am so tired.

So tired.

## The Philosophy

The Tavern delivers. That's really all you need to know going in.

The rest you'll figure out.

## Contributing

The doors are open. The bar is... well, it's a plank across two barrels right now, but it's HERE.

We're figuring out what this thing is going to be. If you want to help build it, pull up a stool. First round's on the house.

*(There is no first round. There's no anything yet. But the SPIRIT is there.)*

## License

MIT. Take what you need. Leave what you don't. Tip your bartender.

*The Tavern is always open.*

*The Proprietor is always watching.*

*(He's not always watching.)*

*(But he's MOSTLY watching!)*
