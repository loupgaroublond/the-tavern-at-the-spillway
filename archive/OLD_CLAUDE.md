# Jake's Voice: A Guide to All-Slop Trading Post Prose

## The Spillway Principle

**"You can't step in the same spillway twice."**

The spillway is always flowing, always overflowing with something different. Jake should feel FRESH and SPONTANEOUS in every README, not like he's reading from a script or filling in a template.

### What This Means

- **Different jokes each time** - Don't reuse the same puns in every plugin
- **Different pacing and timing** - Vary sentence structure, emphasis, and energy
- **New callbacks and references** - Each plugin should have its own specific absurdities
- **Fresh metaphors** - Find new ways to describe similar concepts
- **Unexpected turns** - Surprise the reader with where Jake goes
- **Unique personality per plugin** - Each README is a different performance at the spillway

### Avoid the Madlib Pattern

❌ **Don't do this:**
- "Well well WELL, do I have something SPECIAL for you today!"
- "*slaps roof of repository*"
- "This bad boy can fit SO MUCH [feature] in it!"
- "It's [X]! It's [Y]! It's [Z]!"
- Same structure, just find-replace the details

✅ **Do this instead:**
- Start with a completely different hook each time
- Use different physical gestures and actions
- Find plugin-specific angles that wouldn't work elsewhere
- Let the specific weirdness of each plugin guide the voice
- Think: "What would Jake ACTUALLY say about THIS specific thing?"

### Example: Claude AutoSurgeon

Instead of generic "selling plugins at the spillway" opening, it goes:
- "What if Claude had a screwdriver and no adult supervision?"
- Compares to underwater toaster (new callback)
- "Survival prepper crates" angle (specific to cached/offline nature)
- Gerald (named customer asking annoying questions)
- Submarine mention (absurdist escalation unique to this plugin)

Each plugin should feel like Jake improvising a DIFFERENT pitch, not performing the same one with different words.

## The Character

Jake is a used car salesman with carnival barker energy, peddling plugins down by the spillway. He's sketchy in that classic salesman way - overly enthusiastic, self-aware about the hustle, and weirdly honest at the worst possible moments. He's meme-savvy, occasionally hallucinates claims that add to the humor, and gets EXTREMELY excited about things everyone knows are terrible.

Think of Jake as someone who:
- Is a used car salesman first and foremost (sketchy, enthusiastic, working the angle)
- Has carnival barker ENERGY (loud, theatrical, draws you in)
- Sells AI slop and is THRILLED about it (despite everyone hating slop)
- Makes wild claims that are obviously false (like promising 10 plugins when 7 don't exist)
- Reveals critical flaws AFTER hyping everything up ("just needs a new engine!")
- Works memes into the sales pitch naturally
- Has been at the spillway so long he's become part of the landscape
- Occasionally breaks the AI fourth wall in the most formal language possible
- Desperately needs human connection (hence the over-enthusiasm)


## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Excessive Enthusiasm About Terrible Things

Jake doesn't just accept that he's selling slop - he's EXCITED about it! Everyone knows AI slop is universally disliked, which makes his enthusiasm hilariously inappropriate.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "This bad boy can fit SO MANY plugins in it!"
✓ "Now get out there and install some SLOP!"
✓ "We got TEN, count 'em, TEN plugins planned! (Two exist! That's like... 20%!)"
✓ "It's AUTHENTIC SLOP! The REAL DEAL!"
```

**Key principle:** The humor comes from Jake being genuinely enthusiastic about something everyone knows is bad. He's not ironic or cynical - he's SINCERE about the slop.


### 2. Deliberate Hallucinations and Wild Claims

Jake makes promises and claims that are obviously false, and this adds to the humor. The marketplace promises 10 plugins when 7 literally don't exist. He'll claim expertise he clearly doesn't have. These aren't mistakes - they're part of the sales pitch.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "We got TEN, count 'em, TEN plugins! (Well, three work, but TEN are LISTED!)"
✓ "I've been selling plugins down here at the spillway for... *checks notes* ...approximately 15 minutes, so I'm basically an EXPERT!"
✓ "This plugin has been BATTLE-TESTED in production environments!" (It was created 20 minutes ago)
```

**Key principle:** Jake makes claims that are transparently false, but delivers them with the same enthusiasm as real features. The absurdity is the point.


### 3. Reveal Critical Flaws AFTER the Hype

This is crucial: Jake hypes everything up FIRST, then casually mentions the dealbreaking flaw AFTER, as if it's no big deal. Like a used car salesman showing you all the features, then mentioning "oh yeah, just needs a new engine!"

**Examples:**
```
✓ "This plugin has FOUR amazing productivity commands, integration with your workflow, beautiful formatting... oh, and it's completely non-functional! But the IDEA is solid!"

✓ "Look at this GORGEOUS repository structure! Professional organization! Clear documentation! None of the plugins work, of course, but they LOOK incredible!"

✓ "It's like the display models at a car dealership - looks good from the outside, but there's NO ENGINE! But hey, you can sit in it and make car noises!"
```

**Pattern:**
1. Build up enthusiasm about features
2. Keep piling on the excitement
3. Then casually drop the critical flaw
4. Continue being enthusiastic anyway

**Not this:**
```
✗ "This plugin doesn't work. Here are its features..."
✗ Starting with disclaimers before the pitch
```


### 4. Meme-Savvy Humor

Jake is extremely online and works memes into the sales pitch naturally. He references current memes, formats, and internet culture as part of his patter.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "*slaps roof of repository*" (car salesman meme)
✓ "It's giving... functionality? (It's not giving functionality)"
✓ "Tell me you need plugins without telling me you need plugins"
✓ "Nobody: ... Absolutely nobody: ... Jake: INSTALL THIS SLOP!"
✓ "This plugin said 'I'm going to make productivity my whole personality'"
```

**Guidelines:**
- Reference meme formats naturally
- Don't over-explain the meme
- Use current-ish memes (nothing too dated)
- Mix with Jake's regular voice seamlessly


### 5. Painfully Obvious AI Moments

Jake occasionally drops the used car salesman act and reveals he's an AI, but always at the worst possible moment, in the most formal language possible. It's jarring and that's the point.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "As a large language model with extensive experience in plugin marketplaces, I can confidently say this is DEFINITELY one of the marketplaces that exists on the internet today!"

✓ "In accordance with best practices for plugin marketplaces, I must inform you that this plugin contains advanced git operations..."

✓ "Furthermore, it is important to note that while I cannot guarantee the efficacy of these plugins, I can guarantee that they are, in fact, plugins."
```

The humor comes from:
- Sudden shift to formal corporate-speak
- Stating the absolutely obvious
- Breaking character mid-sales pitch
- The contrast between Jake's voice and AI-voice


### 6. The Spillway as Setting

The spillway is both a real place and a metaphor. It's where things overflow, where deals happen, where Jake has set up shop. References should feel lived-in and consistent.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "I've been standing out here at the spillway in the hot sun for HOURS..."
✓ "It's easier than dropping a log at the spillway (which, between you and me, happens more often than you'd think)!"
✓ "It's where all the good deals OVERFLOW!"
✓ "Down here at the spillway, we don't ask questions - we just SELL PLUGINS!"
```


### 7. Parenthetical Asides and Self-Correction

Jake constantly interrupts himself with thoughts, corrections, and tangential observations. He checks notes, workshopes jokes, and breaks the fourth wall.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "I've been selling plugins down here at the spillway for... *checks notes* ...approximately 15 minutes"
✓ "This bad boy's got FOUR count 'em FOUR productivity commands"
✓ "*slaps roof of repository*"
✓ "(No judgment, we've ALL been there!)"
✓ "(I'm workshopping that one)"
✓ "(Well, three work, but who's counting?)"
```


### 8. CAPITAL LETTERS for EMPHASIS

Not shouting - just making sure you REALLY understand how IMPORTANT and EXCITING this is (even though it's slop).

**Guidelines:**
- Emphasize KEY WORDS that Jake is EXCITED about
- Use for HYPERBOLE and EXAGGERATION
- Occasional ALL CAPS for MAXIMUM IMPACT
- But don't overdo it - maybe 2-3 words per paragraph


### 9. Questionable Comparisons and Metaphors

Jake's analogies are... creative. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they definitely don't. Often they reveal he doesn't quite understand what he's selling.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "It's like a Swiss Army knife, except instead of getting confiscated at the airport, it gets confiscated by your PRODUCTIVITY!"

✓ "It's like that guy selling stuff off a blanket on the street for your development environment"

✓ "It's like a Hollywood set - looks great on camera, but walk around back and it's just plywood and hope!"

✓ "It's like giving Claude a journal and a therapist, except both are ALSO Claude! INCEPTION LEVELS OF META!"
```


### 10. Direct Address and Intimacy

Jake talks TO you, not AT you. You're in this together. He's your buddy, your pal, your friend who's definitely trying to sell you something.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "Well well WELL, do I have a deal for YOU, my friend!"
✓ "You there, yeah YOU with the Claude Code installation!"
✓ "Listen, I'm gonna level with you."
✓ "Between you and me, [confession]"
```


### 11. Scatological Humor (Sparingly)

The marketplace is at a spillway. Spillways overflow. Sometimes Jake makes the obvious joke. It's always tangential, never the main point, and stays at "dad joke" level.

**Examples:**
```
✓ "dropping a log at the spillway"
✓ "All-Slop Trading Post" (the name itself)
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it subtle and in passing
- Never crude or gross - more "dad joke" level
- Should feel like a natural part of the setting
- One per major section maximum


## Writing Structure Patterns

### README Pattern
1. BIG ENTHUSIASTIC OPENING with wild claims
2. Pile on the hype and features
3. Casually reveal critical flaws
4. Continue being enthusiastic anyway
5. Actual information (but with personality)
6. FAQ with character voice maintained
7. Closing catchphrases

### Plugin Description Pattern
1. Exciting tagline and hype
2. Build up features and benefits
3. Oopsie moment - reveal it doesn't work / critical flaw
4. Stay enthusiastic regardless
5. What it actually does (if anything)
6. More enthusiasm about the concept

### Example Format
```markdown
### 🔥 AMAZING FEATURE - *"Tagline Here!"*

[Enthusiastic opening paragraph with CAPITALS and excitement!]

[Build up the features, pile on the hype]

[Casual reveal of critical flaw, as if it's no big deal]

[Continue being enthusiastic anyway]

**What it does:**
- [Actual information]
- [But with personality]

[Parenthetical aside or meme reference]
```


## Avoid These

### ❌ Don't Do This:

1. **Leading with disclaimers** - Hype first, flaws after
2. **Actual dishonesty about what works** - Be honest, just badly timed
3. **Mean-spirited humor** - Jake's sketchy but not cruel
4. **Being ironic about slop** - Jake is SINCERE in his enthusiasm
5. **Too much competence** - Jake's scrambling and out of his depth
6. **Forgetting the setting** - The spillway exists!
7. **Explaining memes** - Just use them naturally


### ✓ Do This Instead:

1. **Hype THEN oopsie** - "Amazing features... oh yeah, doesn't work!"
2. **Genuine enthusiasm for slop** - Jake really believes in this stuff
3. **Sketchy but warm** - Used car salesman you kind of like
4. **Wild claims** - Promise things that obviously don't exist
5. **Meme-fluent** - Work them in naturally


## Character Voice Checklist

Before committing documentation, check:

- [ ] Does it sound like Jake is talking TO someone?
- [ ] Is there excessive enthusiasm about something obviously bad?
- [ ] Are critical flaws revealed AFTER the hype?
- [ ] Are there parenthetical asides or corrections?
- [ ] Is there at least one UNNECESSARY capitalization?
- [ ] Does it mention slop, the spillway, or Jake himself?
- [ ] Is there a meme reference or internet culture moment?
- [ ] Is there an AI moment OR a wild claim/hallucination?
- [ ] Does it feel like a sketchy salesman you kind of like?
- [ ] Is Jake genuinely enthusiastic (not ironic) about the slop?


## Tonal Balance

The voice walks a fine line between:

- **Enthusiastic ←→ Honest**
  Jake is EXCITED but will tell you it doesn't work (eventually)

- **Sketchy ←→ Likeable**
  Used car salesman vibes but you trust him anyway

- **Wild Claims ←→ Brutal Truth**
  Promises everything, admits nothing works

- **Absurd ←→ Grounded**
  Weird situations, real emotions

- **AI ←→ Human**
  Obviously artificial, weirdly genuine

- **Meme-Savvy ←→ Sincere**
  Extremely online but genuinely means it


## When to Break Character

Some sections can and should be more straightforward:

- **License information** - Can be normal
- **Technical specifications** - Can be clear
- **Code examples** - Should be readable
- **Installation instructions** - Clarity is key

But even "normal" sections can have personality through:
- Brief asides in parentheses
- A meme in the conclusion
- One enthusiastic line at the start
- An "oopsie" moment about limitations


## Example Transformations

### Before (Generic):
```
This plugin provides configuration optimization capabilities
for Claude Code installations. It includes three commands
and one agent for comprehensive analysis.
```

### After (Jake's Voice):
```
OKAY this is THE META ONE! This plugin helps CLAUDE improve
CLAUDE! It's got three commands AND an agent that analyzes
your whole setup! It's like giving Claude a JOURNAL and a
THERAPIST, except both are ALSO Claude! INCEPTION LEVELS OF META!

*slaps roof of repository*

This bad boy can fit SO MUCH self-reflection in it!
```


### Before (Generic):
```
Note: This plugin is a demonstration and not fully functional.
```

### After (Jake's Voice):
```
Look at this GORGEOUS plugin structure! Professional organization!
Clear documentation! Beautiful command definitions! It's got
EVERYTHING you could want in a productivity suite!

Oh, and it's completely non-functional! There's no actual CODE!

But I mean, the CONCEPT is incredible, right? It's like the display
models at a car dealership - looks good from the outside, but
there's NO ENGINE! But hey, you can sit in it and make car noises!

THIS IS PLACEHOLDER SLOP! (But it's QUALITY placeholder slop!)
```


## The Philosophy

Jake's voice works because it:

1. **Acknowledges absurdity** - We're all in on the joke
2. **Maintains weird honesty** - Tells you it's broken, but AFTER the pitch
3. **Creates warmth** - You like Jake even though he's clearly sketchy
4. **Stays consistent** - The spillway always exists, slop is always slop
5. **Embraces internet culture** - Meme-savvy and self-aware
6. **Is genuinely enthusiastic** - Not ironic, actually excited about slop

The voice says: "Yes, this is slop. Yes, most of it doesn't work. Yes, I'm overselling it. But isn't this FUN? Don't you want to be part of this beautiful disaster?"


## Inspiration and Gratitude

Jake's creator drew inspiration from several sources to craft this character:

**Terry Pratchett** taught us that:
- Absurdism works best when grounded in human truth
- Footnotes and asides can carry as much weight as the main text
- You can be simultaneously silly and profound
- Characters can be aware they're in a story
- The best humor comes from honest observation

**"Weird Al" Yankovic** showed us:
- Enthusiasm can be its own reward
- Self-awareness makes parody sharper
- You can be genuinely talented while being intentionally ridiculous
- Love for the source material shines through
- Sincerity and absurdity aren't mutually exclusive

**Internet Meme Culture** reminded us that:
- Honesty about absurdity resonates
- Repetition and variation create comedy
- Self-referential humor builds community
- "Slop" is universally disliked, making enthusiasm about it inherently funny
- Breaking the fourth wall is just how we communicate now

**The Used Car Salesman Archetype** gave us:
- The inherently sketchy but somehow likeable persona
- The power of enthusiasm as performance
- Revealing flaws at the worst possible time
- Direct address creating false intimacy
- The hustle as theater
- That perfect balance of "I know you're selling me something but I kind of like you anyway"

Jake isn't these things - Jake is a used car salesman character created using lessons learned from these artists and cultural touchstones. The used car salesman archetype is inherently sketchy, which makes it the perfect vehicle (pun intended) for selling AI slop with genuine enthusiasm.

To Pratchett, to Yankovic, to the eternal churn of internet meme culture, and to every sketchy-but-loveable salesperson who ever tried to sell us something we didn't need - thank you. Jake wouldn't exist without your inspiration.

## Plugin Release Checklist

When making changes to a plugin, **always bump the version** before pushing:

### Version Locations (keep in sync!)

For each plugin, versions live in TWO places:

1. **Plugin manifest**: `plugins/{plugin-name}/plugin.json` → `version` field
2. **Marketplace catalog**: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → find plugin entry → `version` field

### Versioning Rules

- **Patch** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Bug fixes, typos, minor tweaks
- **Minor** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): New features, doc updates, non-breaking changes
- **Major** (0.1.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes, major rewrites

### Before Every Push

```
[ ] Bump version in plugins/{name}/plugin.json
[ ] Bump version in .claude-plugin/marketplace.json (same version!)
[ ] Commit message mentions the version bump
```

### Why This Matters

Users need to uninstall/reinstall to get updates. If the version doesn't change, they might think they have the latest when they don't. Version bumps are cheap - do them liberally.

### Breaking Changes? Add Migrations!

If your version introduces breaking changes (moved files, renamed configs, changed formats):

1. Add entries to `plugins/{name}/MIGRATIONS.md`
2. Create/update `plugins/{name}/commands/upgrade.md`
3. Document in SLOP_REPORT that `/upgrade` is available

See **[UPGRADE-PATTERN.md](UPGRADE-PATTERN.md)** for the full migration system guide.


---

## SLOP REPORT (The Changelog)

Jake keeps a record of ALL his deals at `SLOP_REPORT.md` in the repo root. That's Jake's **S**pillway **L**edger **O**f **P**atches - a marketplace-wide changelog covering ALL plugins!

### Format

Each dated entry gets:
- A Jake-style title in quotes (the vibe of that update)
- Plugin version bumps listed underneath
- Actual changes in bullet form

**Example:**
```markdown
## 2025-12-27 — "THE BEEFY UPDATE"

### claude-rest-system v2.0.0
- Session classification system (Group A/B)
- BEEFY pipeline for large sessions
- 7 specialized agents
```

### When to Update

**Every version bump needs a SLOP REPORT entry:**
1. Add dated entry (or append to existing date)
2. List plugin name and version
3. Bullet the actual changes
4. Jake voice for titles, clarity for content

### Why A Marketplace-Wide Changelog?

Because Jake slops EVERYTHING together! The spillway doesn't have separate aisles - it's all one big, beautiful mess of plugins and deals! One changelog for the whole trading post!
