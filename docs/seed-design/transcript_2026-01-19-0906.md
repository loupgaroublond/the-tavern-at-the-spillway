**Started:** 2026-01-19 09:06

## Notation

- **[U]** Plain text — User's words (high fidelity)
- **[C]** Code block — My responses
- **[T]** *Italics* — My thinking/reasoning
- **[S]** after `___` — Synthesis

## Process Establishment

[09:06]

**[U]** Let's put together a system that will require a lot to explain, so we're going to have a discussion over the next few days. First let's get meta and work out a basic process: I start explaining things, you continuously interview me to make sure you understand, and eventually we put together a basic product document and initial prod reqs along with the beginnings of design documents.

**[U]** You will continuously take notes somewhere. Feel free to break notes into smaller files named with datetime suffix, and when you add content, note the current time. Use the date command as needed. Break files up partly for your own convenience, partly to separate logical ideas.

**[U]** Two kinds of seed inputs: one is my ability to describe this in general strokes and refine as we go, and second is the initial_notes.md file, where we'll iterate through literally every line while I explain what those mean, while you continue asking questions.

**[U]** Keep asking questions — to clarify, fill gaps, explain further, validate understanding. I'll entertain "what if" scenarios or you stating implications I can confirm or deny. Ask questions to look at all sides. Most important: keep asking rather than making assumptions. Ask if you can make certain assumptions in small cases. I want this built to my concept with high fidelity.

**[U]** That said, expect I'll ask for your input too. You'll be an active actor in the final product. I'll ask you to opine what works best for you, and perhaps take direct ownership of some areas so you can make sure it meshes with your best ways of doing things.

**[C]**
```
I set up initial documentation, read initial_notes.md (47 lines of dense seed ideas), and asked four clarifying questions about file organization, session continuity, tangent handling, and pacing.
```

[09:14]

**[U]** Put this in a "seed-design" folder, as a subdir off docs.

**[U]** You're going to need to refer back to notes regularly after compaction anyway, so let's start any clean session with me directing where to start, then you figure out what to read.

**[U]** We can leave placemarkers for tangents as long as you maintain a legend to that map, so we know what to grep for later. Feel free to ask for clarification whether something warrants a new file, when we need tangential documents, or when we're punting on a tangent to come back to it.

**[U]** Regarding pacing: "next few days" means my quantum world, not your latent space of tokens. I want to make sure all the thoughts shake out of my head, and that won't happen in one sitting. Types of questions and discussion will vary depending on where we are and my energy levels — this is why it's critical to maintain an interview log.

**[U]** I'm wondering if it makes sense for you to write an interview transcript too, where you write down what I say, what you respond with, fill in notes from your thinking if worth including. Then every so often, write notes to collect the info into one place. So we have both the initial discussion text and interview notes that synthesize the thinking for the initial planning docs. If you do this, we also need notation to tell whether you're transcribing my words, your words, your thoughts, or synthesis notes.

**[C]**
```
I proposed bracket markers: [Y], [C], [T], [S]. Asked about fidelity level, when to synthesize, file separation, and thinking inclusion threshold.
```

[09:19]

**[U]** How about we underscore the Synthesis instead of H2, italics for thinking, bold for my words, and plain text for yours? We can test this and drop it if it looks bad.

**[U]** Be high fidelity to what I said, but we can make an edited transcript that looks more like an interview you'd read in a magazine or journal.

**[U]** Synthesize when you think you can write down new whole ideas out of the past few rounds. Be extra eager when your context window is almost full. Synthesis can stay inline.

**[U]** Include thinking notes wherever it fundamentally adds understanding. For example, if you're not sure what I mean, you do a thought experiment on possibilities A, B, C, and determine B is the only reasonable understanding — note that you did this thinking and ruled out A and C for B, alongside a synthesis describing B, then follow-up questions to fill gaps.

**[T]** *Testing the format now. The bold/plain/italic distinction is visually cleaner than bracket markers, and underscore synthesis sections will break up the flow naturally without creating a cluttered header hierarchy.*

[09:24]

**[U]** The current state in process violates a critical rule. You have used bold for the initial words, but it's neither a list, nor broken by two new lines. You do this correctly in both ways in other parts of the doc.

**[C]**
```
Fixed three violations: two bold-paragraph blocks converted to proper lists, one stray backtick corrected.
```

**[U]** Flip it, make your text bold, mine regular, keep thinking italics.

**[C]**
```
Done.
```

**[U]** Also, do preface each section of text with the tags [U] and so on too.

**[C]**
```
Done.
```

**[U]** Bold, italics, underlines, we're already using these markers. Is there another formatting option in markdown that you can use for the tags? It looks weird that they're plain text but we're already using all 3 markup options I know of.

**[C]**
```
Suggested code/monospace with backticks for the tags.
```

**[U]** How about you put your section in code blocks, instead of bold, and then we can make those tags bold?

**[C]**
```
Done. Updated format: my responses in code blocks, tags bold.
```

[09:29]

**[U]** Now update the transcript to be current, and then I'll start with the idea.

**[C]**
```
Done.
```

**[S]** Synthesis: Process Established

We have a multi-session discovery process for a complex system. Two input streams: verbal explanation (general → refined) and line-by-line walkthrough of initial_notes.md (47 items).

I ask questions continuously. No assumptions — ask permission even for small ones. User will ask for my input and may assign me ownership of areas where my perspective matters (what works well for AI agents).

Documentation lives in `docs/seed-design/`. Files get datetime suffixes. Timestamps mark additions. Tangents get placemarkers with a greppable legend. Session pickup: user directs starting point, I figure out what to read.

Two artifacts maintained: transcript (this file) and synthesis notes (inline). Synthesis triggered by: new whole ideas emerging, or approaching context limit.

Notation: **[U]** user plain, **[C]** claude code block, **[T]** thinking italics, **[S]** synthesis after `___` divider.
