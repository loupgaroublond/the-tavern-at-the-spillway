## Handoff Documentation Created

**[U]** *(Previous session, context from handoff docs)*

User requested handoff documentation to enable smooth session continuity. Previous session (cozy-sprouting-grove) had grown long and app was getting slow.

**[C]** Created two handoff documents:

1. **`handoff-2026-01-21.md`** — Complete project context:
   - Project structure and tech stack
   - Seed design interview methodology
   - Build/test/commit workflows
   - Current state (what works, known bugs)
   - All 5 design principles
   - Key files reference
   - Next steps

2. **`handoff-sessions-2026-01-21.md`** — Session archaeology:
   - Major sessions (current, design, implementation)
   - Supporting sessions (easter eggs, jokes)
   - How to use rewind agent
   - Example queries

## New Session Review

**[U]** Check seed design handoff docs, and then report back in.

**[C]** Read both handoff docs. Summarized contents:
- handoff-2026-01-21.md covers full project state
- handoff-sessions-2026-01-21.md catalogs session history for rewind

Docs are ready to commit.

## Performance Requirements Discussion

**[U]** Document a new requirement that everything stay fast, under all conditions. Sessions may get long, agents may manage many subagents. Data structures must be performant even with super long history or multiple compactions. UI needs to stay snappy — don't bog down by loading entire session when it's offscreen. Need performance testing as part of mandatory validation.

**[C]** Questions to clarify: What's the upper bound? Definition of "fast" (latency targets)? Memory vs speed tradeoffs?

**[U]** Upper bound is no limit, but staying ahead of power users is sufficient. Most important: zillions of messages don't impact viewing current chat. Tradeoffs at borders — search window should pop up fast even if it spins while searching, but search shouldn't bog down other parts of app. RAM budget: evaluate perception boundaries. Cold start should be perceived fast. Debug mode is a perception boundary. Network ops beyond our control, but responsiveness isn't. Find limits first, then decide degradation behavior.

**[C]** So the principle is perception-bounded performance. Key concepts: isolation (heavy ops don't impact unrelated work), responsiveness over speed (UI always responds, show feedback), perception boundaries (where users expect delay), scale independence (visible slice stays fast regardless of history size).

**[U]** A perception boundary is where the user expects delay, like a thorough search, or scrolling back a big discussion.

**[C]** Refined definition: zones where the user's mental model already includes "this might take a moment." We lean into those with appropriate feedback. Anywhere the user doesn't expect delay, there must be none.

**[U]** Stress testing is a testing requirement. Perception boundaries discovered during development. Scale independence works.

**[T]** *Two requirements documented:*

1. **Performance Requirement (Section 19)** — Perception-bounded performance with four core rules: isolation, responsiveness over speed, perception boundaries, scale independence. Plus cancellation (context-dependent) and RAM budget (no fixed target, avoid system pressure).

2. **Stress Testing (added to Section 16)** — Mandatory performance testing: synthetic load, measure responsiveness, verify isolation, establish baselines, catch regressions.
