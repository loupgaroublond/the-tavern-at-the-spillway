## Handoff Documentation Created

**[U]** *(Previous session, context from handoff docs)*

User requested handoff documentation to enable smooth session continuity. Previous session (cozy-sprouting-grove) had grown long and app was getting slow.

**[C]** Created two handoff documents:

1. **`handoff-2026-01-21.md`** — Complete project context:
   - Project structure and tech stack
   - Seed design interview methodology
   - Build/test/commit workflows
   - Current state (what works, known bugs)
   - All 5 design principles
   - Key files reference
   - Next steps

2. **`handoff-sessions-2026-01-21.md`** — Session archaeology:
   - Major sessions (current, design, implementation)
   - Supporting sessions (easter eggs, jokes)
   - How to use rewind agent
   - Example queries

## New Session Review

**[U]** Check seed design handoff docs, and then report back in.

**[C]** Read both handoff docs. Summarized contents:
- handoff-2026-01-21.md covers full project state
- handoff-sessions-2026-01-21.md catalogs session history for rewind

Docs are ready to commit.
