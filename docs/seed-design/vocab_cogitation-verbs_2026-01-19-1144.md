- Consider seasonal/holiday variants (Pesach-cleaning, Purim-tumbling, etc.)
- Some words are obscene or near-obscene (shtupping) — flag for user preference
- **Don't force -ing form**: Where awkward, use natural forms (e.g., "farblondzhet" not "farblondzhet-ing", "farklempt" not "farklempt-ing"). The display can be "Status: farblondzhet" rather than "farblondzhet-ing..."
