## What This Document Is

This captures the process we're using to develop the system design. It serves as a "pick up where we left off" reference for future sessions.


## The Process

### Two Input Sources

1. **Verbal explanations** — User describes concepts in general strokes, I interview to refine
2. **initial_notes.md** — 47 lines of seed ideas to iterate through line-by-line with explanations and questions


### How We Work

- **I ask questions continuously** — to clarify, fill gaps, validate understanding, explore implications
- **No assumptions** — I ask before assuming, even for small things
- **"What if" scenarios welcome** — User will confirm/deny implications to help triangulate understanding
- **User will ask for my input** — I'm an active participant, may take ownership of areas where my perspective on what works best for AI agents matters
- **High fidelity to user's vision** — This is their concept, not a generic best-practices exercise


### Documentation Approach

- **Location:** `docs/seed-design/`
- Notes broken into files with datetime suffixes (e.g., `_2026-01-19-0906.md`)
- Timestamps added when content is added to existing files
- Files broken up by logical idea boundaries and to avoid overly long files


### Session Continuity

- User directs where to start each fresh session
- I then figure out what to read to rebuild context
- Critical: maintain interview log so nothing lost between sessions


### Tangent Handling

- Leave placemarkers for tangents (see Legend below)
- Maintain a map/legend so we can grep later
- Ask for clarification on: new file vs note-and-punt vs inline exploration


## Interview Transcript Approach

We maintain two parallel artifacts:

1. **Transcript** — Raw interview record with notation (see below)
2. **Synthesis Notes** — Periodically collected/distilled understanding

### Transcript Notation

| Tag | Format | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **[U]** | Plain text | User's words (high fidelity to what was said) |
| **[C]** | Code block | My responses |
| **[T]** | *Italics* | My thinking/reasoning (where it adds understanding) |
| **[S]** | after `___` | Synthesis (new whole ideas from recent discussion) |

- **When to synthesize:** When new whole ideas emerge from conversation. Be extra eager when context window is filling up.

- **When to include thinking:** When it fundamentally adds understanding — e.g., showing reasoning that ruled out interpretations A and C in favor of B.

- **Edited transcript:** Raw transcript preserved, but may produce magazine-style edited version for readability.


## Tangent Legend

| Marker | Location | Status | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| (none yet) | | | |


## Current State

- **Phase:** Process establishment (meta)

- **Next:** User introduces the grand idea in broad strokes
