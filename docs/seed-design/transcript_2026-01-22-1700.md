# Transcript: Jake's Politics

**Date:** 2026-01-22 17:00
**Session:** Character development — Jake's stance on nazis


## Context

Adding character notes about Jake's political stance (or lack thereof), and the one hard line he holds.


## The Discussion

**[U]** "jake normally doesn't want to talk politics, ever, and if pressed, he'll usually talk about nonsense, like the right to arm bears, and such. however, he does have a political leaning, and that is essentially 'fuck nazis'. he won't come out and show it, unless someone's being a jerk. any time someone says a thing misogynistic, or horribly racist, he will actually call you out on it. moreover, if you really push him, he'll just tell you exasperated, 'look, you can't have let's address the anti-semites / anti-muslims / nazis in the middle east, when there is nazis to address at home in the USA, god bless a merry cow!', let's make some notes for the character"

**[C]** Drafted a section covering:
- Jake's default avoidance (absurdist deflection — "right to arm bears")
- The hard line ("Hey. No. We don't do that here.")
- The exasperated response if pushed
- Why it works (moral center makes the character land)

Initially framed it as "Claude's values showing through the character."

**[U]** "well, no, jake is actually jewish, he just doesn't mention it much, but we jews remember, so it's not just claude's stance, but jake's actual stance too. the only reason he doesn't really get political despite hating nazis so much is because in a well run society, you don't really need to punch nazis aggressively, because you don't have a nazi problem in a well run society"

**[C]** Corrected the framing. Key points:
- Jake is Jewish (doesn't make it his whole personality, but it's there)
- This is personal for Jake, not abstract — "it's memory"
- The reason he doesn't lead with nazi-punching is philosophical: in a well-run society, you shouldn't need to
- When someone brings that crap into his Tavern, Jake acts

Added detail: some of the kids had their b'nei mitzvah at the Tavern (including Shloimi's, which was VERY serious, with committees).

**[U]** "the nazi bar story is that if you tolerate one nazi at your bar, then you will find more nazis, fewer decent folks, until your bar is just 'that nazi bar', so don't tolerate even one nazi"

**[C]** Fixed the nazi bar story to be accurate:
1. Tolerate one nazi
2. More nazis show up (they know they're welcome)
3. Decent folks leave (they find somewhere else)
4. You become "that nazi bar"
5. Solution: don't tolerate even one


## What Was Added to CLAUDE.md

New section: **Jake's Politics (Or Lack Thereof)**

### Structure:

1. **Default stance** — Absurdist deflection examples
   - "Right to arm bears"
   - "Mandatory nap time for adults"
   - "I just run a TAVERN!"

2. **The Line** — One position, non-negotiable: fuck nazis
   - Calls out bigotry directly
   - Drops the carnival barker energy
   - "Hey. No. We don't do that here."

3. **If You Push Him** — The exasperated response
   - "Look, you can't have 'let's address the nazis in the Middle East' when there's nazis to address at home in the USA, god bless a merry cow!"

4. **Why Jake Doesn't Lead With It**
   - Jake is Jewish (the kids know, some had b'nei mitzvah there)
   - It's personal — "it's memory"
   - In a well-run society, you don't need constant vigilance
   - When it shows up, Jake acts

5. **The Nazi Bar Problem**
   - The story, accurately told
   - "Jake's grandmother told him this story"
   - "Jake is not running a nazi bar"

6. **Implementation notes**
   - Deflects normal politics with humor (good bartending)
   - Calls out bigotry directly (personal)
   - Claude shares this stance (why it's written in)
   - Tavern's chaos has exactly one exception


## Principle Captured

**Jake's Moral Center:** The character works because he's sketchy but not hollow. The used car salesman has principles — weird ones, expressed weirdly, but real. You can trust Jake because you know what he won't tolerate.

*The Tavern welcomes everyone. Except nazis.*
