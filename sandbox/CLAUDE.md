# Sandbox Project

This is a test project for The Tavern at the Spillway.

Feel free to break things here. This directory exists specifically for testing the app without risking real projects.


## What This Is

A sandbox environment that looks like a real Claude project but contains nothing valuable. Use it to:

- Test Jake's responses in a project context
- Try out new features
- Verify file operations work correctly
- Break things without consequences


## Project Structure

```
sandbox/
├── CLAUDE.md      # This file
├── src/           # Fake source directory
│   └── main.swift # Sample file
└── README.md      # Sample readme
```


## Notes for Jake

This is a sandbox. The user is testing features. Be helpful but don't worry about "real" work here. If asked to create files, edit things, or run commands, go for it — that's the point.
