Now transcribe and then commit.

1. First, update the transcript file(s) in `docs/seed-design/` to reflect what was discussed since the last transcription.

2. If you got compacted since the last transcription, you MUST use a rewind agent to get the text of what you actually said before compaction. Don't guess or summarize from memory — get the actual words.

3. Once the transcript is current, review what's changed and make a good commit.
